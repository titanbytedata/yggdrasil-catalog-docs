## Issues and feature requests

You've found a bug in the source code, a mistake in the documentation or maybe you'd like a new feature? Take a look at [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/titanbytedata/yggdrasil-catalog/discussions) to see if it's already being discussed. You can help us by [submitting an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/titanbytedata/yggdrasil-catalog/issues). Before you create an issue, make sure to search the issue archive -- your issue may have already been addressed!

Please try to create bug reports that are:

- _Reproducible._ Include steps to reproduce the problem.
- _Specific._ Include as much detail as possible: which version, what environment, etc.
- _Unique._ Do not duplicate existing opened issues.
- _Scoped to a Single Bug._ One bug per report.

**Even better: Submit a pull request with a fix or new feature!**
